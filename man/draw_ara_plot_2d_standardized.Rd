\title{Draws an Adaptable Radial Axes (ARA) plot}
\usage{
draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized(
  Z,
  X,
  V,
  P,
  weights = rep(1, ncol(Z)),
  axis_lines = NULL,
  color_variable = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{Standardized numeric data matrix of dimensions N x n, where N is the number of observations, and n is the number of variables.}

\item{X}{Original numeric data matrix (before standardizing) of dimensions N x n}

\item{V}{Numeric matrix of "axis vectors" of dimensions n x 2, where each row of \code{V} defines an axis vector.}

\item{P}{Numeric data matrix of dimensions N x 2 containing the N 2-dimensional representations of the data observations
(i.e., the embedded points).}

\item{weights}{Numeric array specifying non-negative weights associated with each variable. Can also be a 1D matrix. Default:
array of n ones.}

\item{axis_lines}{Array of integer variable indices (in [1,n]) indicating which calibrated axis lines are to be displayed.
Default: NULL.}

\item{color_variable}{Integer (in [1,n]) that indicates the variable used to color the embedded points. Default: NULL.}

\description{
Creates a plot associated with an Adaptable Radial Axes (ARA) mapping
}
\details{
The function \code{draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized()} generates a basic two-dimensional plot related to an "Adaptable
Radial Axes" (ARA) mapping (Rubio-Sánchez, 2017) for high-dimensional numerical data (\code{X}) that has been previously
standardized (\code{Z}). The plot displays a set of 2D points (\code{P}), each representing an observation from the
high-dimensional dataset. It also includes a collection of axis vectors (\code{V}), each corresponding to a specific
data variable. If the ARA mapping incorporates weights (\code{weights}), these axis vectors are colored accordingly to
reflect the weighting. For a user-specified subset of variables (\code{axis_lines}), the function additionally draws
axis lines with tick marks that represent values of the selected variables. Users can estimate the values of the
high-dimensional data by visually projecting the plotted points orthogonally onto these axes. The plotted points can
also be colored according to the values of the variable \code{color_variable}.

\examples{
# Load data
library(ascentTraining) # contains the Auto MPG dataset
data("auto_mpg")

# Define subset of (numerical) variables
selected_variables <- c(1,4,5,6)   # 1:"mpg", 4:"horsepower", 5:"weight", 6:"acceleration")

# Retain only selected variables and rename dataset as X
X <- auto_mpg[, selected_variables] # Select a subset of variables
rm(auto_mpg)

# Remove rows with missing values from X
N <- nrow(X)
rows_to_delete <- NULL
for (i in 1:N) {
  if (sum(is.na(X[i, ])) > 0) {
    rows_to_delete <- c(rows_to_delete, -i)
  }
}
X <- X[rows_to_delete, ]

# Convert X to matrix
X <- apply(as.matrix.noquote(X), 2, as.numeric)

# Standardize data
Z <- scale(X)

# Define axis vectors (2-dimensional in this example)
library(geometry)
r <- c(0.8, 1, 1.2, 1)
theta <- c(225, 100, 315, 80) * 2 * pi / 360
V <- pol2cart(theta, r)

# Define weights
weights <- c(1, 0.75, 0.75, 1)

# Compute the mapping
mapping <- ara_unconstrained_L2(Z, V, weights = weights, solver = "formula")

# Select variables with labeled axis lines on ARA plot
axis_lines <- c(1,4)   # 1:"mpg", 4:"acceleration")

# Select variable used for coloring embedded points
color_variable <- 1    # "mpg"

# Draw the ARA plot

  Z,
  X,
  V,
  mapping$P,
  weights = weights,
  axis_lines = axis_lines,
  color_variable = color_variable
