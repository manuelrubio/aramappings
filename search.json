ARA performs dimensionality reduction representing high-dimensional numerical data points plane three-dimensional space. Unlike many dimensionality reduction methods, ARA plots also visualize variable-specific information “axis vectors” corresponding labeled axis lines, vector associated particular data variable. axis vectors (interactively defined users, Star Coordinates) indicate directions values associated variables increase within plot. Additionally, high-dimensional observations mapped (optimal sense) onto plot order allow users estimate variable values visually projecting points onto labeled axes, Biplots.
