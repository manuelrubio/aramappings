# Introduction to aramappings

## Introduction to Adaptable Radial Axes (ARA) plots

Adaptable Radial Axes (ARA) plots ([Rubio-Sánchez, Sanchez, and Lehmann
2017](#ref-Rubio17)) are an interactive, exploratory data visualization
technique related to Star Coordinates ([Kandogan 2000](#ref-Kandogan00),
[2001](#ref-Kandogan01)) and Biplots ([Gabriel 1971](#ref-Gabriel71);
[Gower and Hand 1995](#ref-Gower95); [Hofmann 2004](#ref-Hofmann04);
[Grange, Roux, and Gardner-Lubbe 2009](#ref-laGrange09); [Greenacre
2010](#ref-Greenacre10)). ARA performs dimensionality reduction by
representing high-dimensional numerical data as points in a plane or
three-dimensional space. Unlike many other dimensionality reduction
methods, ARA plots also visualize variable-specific information through
“axis vectors” and their corresponding labeled axis lines, where each
vector is associated with a particular data variable. These axis vectors
(interactively defined by users, as in Star Coordinates) indicate the
directions in which the values of their associated variables increase
within the plot. Additionally, the high-dimensional observations are
mapped (in an optimal sense) onto the plot in order to allow users to
estimate variable values by visually projecting these points onto the
labeled axes, as in Biplots.

labeled axes, as in
Biplots.](../reference/figures/vignette_cereals_ara_bb.jpg)

ARA plot of four variables of a breakfast cereal dataset.
High-dimensional data values can be estimated via projections onto the
labeled axes, as in Biplots.

  

In the previous ARA plot, the “axis” vectors associated with the
variables are chosen to distinguish between healthier cereals (toward
the right) and less healthy ones (toward the left). For instance, points
on the right will generally have larger values of Protein and Vitamins,
and lower values of Sugar and Calories. Users can obtain approximations
of data values by visually projecting the plotted points onto the
labeled axes. For example, users would estimate a value of about 57
calories for the point that lies further to the right.

### Formal definition

ARA plots are obtained by solving the following general convex
optimization problem:

\\\begin{array}{cl} \displaystyle \begin{array}{c}\mathrm{minimize} \\
\mathbf{P} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times m} \end{array} & \hspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{array}{c} \\ (\mathbf{P}\mathbf{V}^{\scriptstyle \top} -
\mathbf{X})\mathbf{W} \\, \\ \\ \end{array} \\\[10pt\] \text{subject to}
& \mathcal{C}. \\ \end{array}\\

Here, we use the following notation:

- \\N\\: Number of data observations = number of mapped points.
- \\n\\: Number of data variables.
- \\m\\: Dimensionality of the visualization space (2 or 3).
- \\\mathbf{X}\\: Data matrix of dimensions \\N\times n\\, where each
  row represents a data observation.
- \\\mathbf{V}\\: \\n\times m\\ matrix of axis vectors. The \\i\\-th row
  is the axis vector associated with the \\i\\-th data variable.
- \\\mathbf{W}\\: \\n\times n\\ diagonal matrix containing non-negative
  weights. The \\i\\-th weight is related to the \\i\\-th data variable.
- \\\mathbf{P}\\: Matrix of mapped (or “embedded”) points of dimensions
  \\N\times m\\. Each row is the low-dimensional representation (i.e.,
  the mapped point) of a data observation.
- \\\\ \cdot \\\\: A matrix norm.
- \\\mathcal{C}\\: Some possible constraints.

Similarly to Biplots, the product \\\mathbf{P}\mathbf{V}^{\scriptstyle
\top}\\ represents the estimates of data values in \\\mathbf{X}\\ when
projecting the mapped points in \\\mathbf{P}\\ on to the axes defined by
\\\mathbf{V}\\. Thus, the goal consists of finding optimal embedded
points to minimize the discrepancy between the original data values and
the estimates. Lastly, matrix \\\mathbf{W}\\ can be used to control
relative accuracy of the estimates on each variable.

It is also worth noting that the variables should have a similar
scaling. Otherwise, the solutions would focus on providing more accurate
estimates for variables with larger values. In addition, centering the
data leads to more accurate estimates in general. Thus, in practice, we
recommend standardizing the data, which would center the data and force
each variable to have unit variance.

### Types of ARA plots

In the current version of the **aramappings** package there are 9 types
of ARA plots, which stem from the combination of three types of matrix
norms, and three choices regarding constraints.

#### Matrix norm

The current version of the package considers three norms:

- \\\\ \cdot \\\_{F}^{2}\\: Squared \\\ell^{2}\\ (Frobenius) norm (sum
  of squares of the entries)
- \\\\ \cdot \\\_{1}\\: \\\ell^{1}\\ norm (sum of absolute values of the
  entries)
- \\\\ \cdot \\\_{\infty}\\: \\\ell^{\infty}\\ norm (maximum of absolute
  values of the entries)

The choice of norm reflects the analyst’s tolerance for large estimation
errors. The \\\ell^{\infty}\\ norm emphasizes minimizing the maximum
estimation error across all variables or axes, making it suitable when
the worst-case error is critical. The \\\ell^{2}\\ norm also penalizes
larger errors, but to a lesser extent. In contrast, the \\\ell^{1}\\
norm allows for some large estimation errors if doing so leads to
significantly smaller errors for other variables.

#### Problem constraints

The current version of the package considers three options regarding the
constraints of the ARA optimization problem:

- **Unconstrained** problems. These formulations do not include
  constraints but may incorporate the weight matrix \\\mathbf{W}\\,
  which, in combination with the lengths of the axis vectors, can be
  used to control the desired relative accuracy when estimating values
  of specific variables. Variables with higher associated weights or
  longer axis vectors will receive greater emphasis in the optimization.
- **Exact** estimates for one of the variables. In these problems, the
  weight matrix \\\mathbf{W}\\ is not used.
- **Ordered** estimates for one variable. This variant imposes a weaker
  constraint. Instead of requiring exact value estimates for a variable,
  it is sufficient that the estimates preserve the ranking of the
  original data values. As with the exact case, the weight matrix
  \\\mathbf{W}\\ is not used in these formulations.

#### Available functions in aramappings

The **aramappings** package contains nine functions to compute ARA
mappings (i.e., the embedded points in \\\mathbf{P}\\), according to the
chosen norm and type of constraints. The names of thefunctions are shown
in the following table:

|                                 | Unconstrained                                                                                               | Exact                                                                                       | Ordered                                                                                         |

The package also contains an additional basic function for drawing
two-dimensional ARA plots when using standardized data:

- [`draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized()`](https://manuelrubio.github.io/aramappings/reference/draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized.md)

The function is included in order to show the results of the ARA mapping
functions (i.e., the embedded points), together wirh the axis vectors
and labeled axis lines. However, it does not consider several aspects
that may be necessary for generating a clear visualization. Note that
ARA should be implemented within an interactive visualization
environment that offers extensive features. Such a tool should allow
users to dynamically manipulate plots (e.g., by modifying axis vectors;
customizing or toggling elements such as axes, labels, and variable
names; encoding additional data dimensions through point color, size, or
shape; and animating transitions between plots).

```

## Usage examples

This section presents several usage examples.

### Unconstrained ARA plot with the \\\ell^{2}\\ norm

We recommend starting an exploratory analysis using an unconstrained ARA
plot with the \\\ell^{2}\\ norm, which can be generated very efficiently
since the mappings (\\\mathbf{P}\\) can be obtained through a
closed-form expression (i.e., a formula). The obvious first step is to
load the **aramappings** package:

``` r
# Load package
library(aramappings)
```

In the usage examples we will use the **Auto MPG** dataset available in
Kaggle, the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Frank and Asuncion 2010),
and can also be found in packages available at CRAN. In particular, we
select a subset of numerical variables from the dataset. The selected
variables are specified through a vector containing their column indices
in the original dataset. Furthermore, we rename the data set to `X`,
simply for clarity with respect to the notation defined above.

``` r
# Define subset of (numerical) variables
selected_variables <- c(1, 4, 5, 6) # 1:"mpg", 4:"horsepower", 5:"weight", 6:"acceleration")
n <- length(selected_variables)

# Retain only selected variables and rename dataset as X
X <- auto_mpg[, selected_variables] # Select a subset of variables
```

The ARA functions halt if the data or other parameters contain missing
values. Thus, we proceed eliminating any row (data observation) that
contains missing values. Naturally, another approach consists of
replacing missing values by some other substituted values (imputation).

``` r
# Remove rows with missing values from X
N <- nrow(X)
rows_to_delete <- NULL
for (i in 1:N) {
  if (sum(is.na(X[i, ])) > 0) {
    rows_to_delete <- c(rows_to_delete, -i)
  }
}
X <- X[rows_to_delete, ]
```

At this moment `X` is a data.frame. In order to use the ARA functions we
first need to convert it to a matrix:

``` r
# Convert X to matrix
X <- apply(as.matrix.noquote(X), 2, as.numeric)
```

In addition, we strongly recommend standardizing the data when using
ARA. We save the result in variable `Z` since the function that draws
the plot needs the original values in `X`.

``` r
# Standardize data
Z <- scale(X)
```

Having preprocessed the data, the next step consists of defining the
axis vectors, which are the rows of \\\mathbf{V}\\. These can be
obtained manually (ideally through a graphical user interface), or
through an automatic method. For instante, \\\mathbf{V}\\ could be the
matrix defining the Principal Component Analysis transfomation (in that
case the ARA plot would be a Principal Component Biplot). In this
example, we simply define a configuration of vectors in polar
coordinates and transform them to Cartesian coordinates.

``` r
# Define axis vectors (2-dimensional in this example)
r <- c(0.8, 1, 1.2, 1)
theta <- c(225, 100, 315, 80) * 2 * pi / 360
V <- pracma::zeros(n, 2)
for (i in 1:n) {
  V[i,1] <- r[i] * cos(theta[i])
  V[i,2] <- r[i] * sin(theta[i])
}
```

It is also possible to define weights in order to control the relative
importance of estimating accurately on each axis. This is nevertheless
complex, since the accuracy also depends on the length of the axis
vectors. In this case, we have set two weigths to 1 and another two to
0.75. Visually, the weights determine the level of gray used to color
the axis vectors in the ARA plot.

``` r
# Define weights
weights <- c(1, 0.75, 0.75, 1)
```

Having defined the data (`Z`), axis vectors (`V`), and weights
(`weights`), we can proceed to compute the ARA mapping. For
unconstrained ARA plots with the \\\ell^{2}\\ norm the `solver`
parameter should be set to “formula” (the default), in order to obtain
the mapping through a closed-form expression. The following code
computes the embedded points and saves them in `mapping$P`, and shows
the execution runtime involved in computing the mapping.

``` r
# Compute the mapping and print the execution time
start <- Sys.time()
mapping <- ara_unconstrained_l2(
  Z,
  V,
  weights = weights,
  solver = "formula"
)
end <- Sys.time()
message(c('Execution time: ',end - start, ' seconds'))
#> Execution time: 0.00263094902038574 seconds
```

ARA plots can get cluttered when showing all of the axis lines and
corresponding labels at the tick marks. Thus, the function that we will
use to draw the ARA plot
([`draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized()`](https://manuelrubio.github.io/aramappings/reference/draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized.md))
contains a parameter called `axis_lines` for specifying the subset of
axis lines (and labels) we wish to visualize. In this example we will
show the axes associated with variables “mpg” and “acceleration”. Note
that in the original data frame these were variables 1 and 6. However,
since we only retained four variables (“mpg”, “horsepower”, “weight”,
and “acceleration”), the column index of “acceleration” is now 4.

``` r
# Select variables with labeled axis lines on ARA plot
axis_lines <- c(1, 4) # 1:"mpg", 4:"acceleration")
```

Also, the plotted points can be colored according to the values of a
particular variable. In this example, we will color the points according
to the value of variable “mpg”.

``` r
# Select variable used for coloring embedded points
color_variable <- 1 # "mpg"
```

Finally, we generate the ARA plot by calling
[`draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized()`](https://manuelrubio.github.io/aramappings/reference/draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized.md):

``` r
# Draw the ARA plot
draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized(
  Z,
  X,
  V,
  mapping$P,
  weights = weights,
  axis_lines = axis_lines,
  color_variable = color_variable
)
```

dataset.](../reference/figures/vignette_autompg_unconstrained_l2_bb.jpg)

dataset.

 

### Exact and ordered ARA plots

Exact and ordered ARA plots do not use weights, but it is necessary to
specify the variable for which to obtain exact estimates, or for
ordering the plotted points:

``` r
variable <- 1 # "mpg"
```

#### Exact ARA plot

The exact ARA mapping for the \\\ell^{2}\\ norm is computed through:

``` r
# Compute the mapping and print the execution time
start <- Sys.time()
mapping <- ara_exact_l2(
  Z,
  V,
  variable = variable,
  solver = "formula"
)
end <- Sys.time()
message(c('Execution time: ',end - start, ' seconds'))
#> Execution time: 0.692009210586548 seconds
```

Note that it is also very efficient since the solution can also be
expressed as a formula. Finally, we generate the ARA plot:

``` r
# Draw the ARA plot
draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized(
  Z,
  X,
  V,
  mapping$P,
  axis_lines = axis_lines,
  color_variable = color_variable
)
```

![Exact ARA plot with the l2 norm of a subset of the Autompg dataset.
Exact estimates are obtained for variable
'mpg'.](../reference/figures/vignette_autompg_exact_l2_bb.jpg)

Exact ARA plot with the l2 norm of a subset of the Autompg dataset.
Exact estimates are obtained for variable ‘mpg’.

 

Note that the colors of the plotted points are in consonance with their
position along the “mpg” axis.

#### Ordered ARA plot

The optimization problem for the ordered ARA mapping with the
\\\ell^{2}\\ is a quadratic program (QP). The following code solves the
problem through the **clarabel** package.

``` r
# Compute the mapping and print the execution time
start <- Sys.time()
mapping <- ara_ordered_l2(
  Z,
  V,
  variable = variable,
  solver = "clarabel"
)
end <- Sys.time()
message(c('Execution time: ',end - start, ' seconds'))
#> Execution time: 0.0216567516326904 seconds
```

Finally, we generate the ARA plot:

``` r
# Draw the ARA plot
draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized(
  Z,
  X,
  V,
  mapping$P,
  axis_lines = axis_lines,
  color_variable = color_variable
)
```

![Ordered ARA plot with the l2 norm of a subset of the Autompg dataset.
The values of 'mpg' are ordered correctly along its corresponding
axis.](../reference/figures/vignette_autompg_ordered_l2_bb.jpg)

Ordered ARA plot with the l2 norm of a subset of the Autompg dataset.
The values of ‘mpg’ are ordered correctly along its corresponding axis.

 

Although the estimates for “mpg” are not exact, the values of “mpg” are
ordered correctly along the corresponding axes. In comparison with the
exact mapping, the ordered variant produces more accurate estimates for
other variables.

### ARA plots using parallel processing

ARA mappings of unconstrained and exact problems with the \\\ell^{1}\\
or \\\ell^{\infty}\\ can be computed in parallel using several cores.
The ideal number of cores to use depends on the size of the input data
matrix. In general, it grows with the number of observations. Users are
advised to analyze runtimes on their computers to estimate an adequate
number of cores to use on their data.

In the following example, we use 2 workers/cores when testing the code
in CRAN. Otherwise we detect the available number of cores (`NCORES`)
with package **parallelly** (if installed) or **parallel**, and use half
of them (if several are available).

``` r
chk <- Sys.getenv("_R_CHECK_LIMIT_CORES_", "")

if (nzchar(chk) && chk == "TRUE") {
  # use 2 cores in CRAN
  NCORES <- 2L
} else {
  # use all cores in devtools::test()
  if (requireNamespace("parallelly", quietly = TRUE)) {
    NCORES <- parallelly::availableCores(omit = 1)
  } else {
    NCORES <- max(1,parallel::detectCores() - 1)
  }
  if (NCORES > 1) {
    NCORES <- floor(NCORES / 2)
  }  
}
```

We then create a cluster object with function `makeCluster()` of the
**parallel** package, specifying the number of cores to use.

``` r
# Create a cluster for parallel processing
cl <- parallel::makeCluster(NCORES)
```

In this example we will compute an ARA unconstrained mapping with the
\\\ell^{1}\\ norm. This function admits weights, and lets us choose
between several solvers. When using the solver from package **glpkAPI**
we can specify whether to use a simplex algorithm, when parameter
`use_glpkAPI_simplex` is set to `TRUE`, or an interior point method if
it is set to `FALSE`. Lastly, the parameter `cluster` is the cluster
object created above.

``` r
# Compute the mapping and print the execution time
start <- Sys.time()
mapping <- ara_unconstrained_l1(
  Z,
  V,
  weights = weights,
  solver = "glpkAPI",
  use_glpkAPI_simplex = TRUE,
  cluster = cl
)
end <- Sys.time()
message(c('Execution time: ',end - start, ' seconds'))
#> Execution time: 0.271854877471924 seconds
```

The ARA plot generated through:

``` r
draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized(
  Z,
  X,
  V,
  mapping$P,
  weights = weights,
  axis_lines = axis_lines,
  color_variable = color_variable
)
```

![Unconstrained ARA plot with the l1 norm of a subset of the Autompg
dataset.](../reference/figures/vignette_autompg_unconstrained_l1_bb.jpg)

Unconstrained ARA plot with the l1 norm of a subset of the Autompg
dataset.

 

Alternatively, the following code computes an exact ARA mapping with the
\\\ell^{1}\\ norm:

``` r
# Compute the mapping and print the execution time
start <- Sys.time()
mapping <- ara_exact_l1(
  Z,
  V,
  variable = variable,
  solver = "glpkAPI",
  use_glpkAPI_simplex = TRUE,
  cluster = cl
)
end <- Sys.time()
message(c('Execution time: ',end - start, ' seconds'))
#> Execution time: 0.180907726287842 seconds
```

The ARA plot generated through:

``` r
draw_ara_plot_2d_standardized(
  Z,
  X,
  V,
  mapping$P,
  axis_lines = axis_lines,
  color_variable = color_variable
)
```

![Exact ARA plot with the l1 norm of a subset of the Autompg dataset.
Exact estimates are obtained for variable
'mpg'.](../reference/figures/vignette_autompg_exact_l1_bb.jpg)

Exact estimates are obtained for variable ‘mpg’.

 

Lastly, the cluster should be stopped at the end of the exploratory
analysis process. It is not necessary to start a cluster and stop it
after computing a single ARA mapping.

``` r
# Stop cluster
parallel::stopCluster(cl)
```
